polyglot-tsp-examples
=====================

Often when I (@basic82) want to assess an unfamiliar language, I code
up a Travelling Salesman Problem
([TSP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem))
'solver' that (1) parses a problem instance from the
[TSPLIB](http://www.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/groups/comopt/software/TSPLIB95/)
repository and (2) gropes around the solution space by randomly
generating tours. Sometimes I go as far as implementing [hill
climbing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_climbing).

Needless to say, these programs are _not_ serious attempts at
combinatorial optimization.
