polyglot-tsp-examples
=====================

Often when I (@basic82) want to assess an unfamiliar language, I code
up a Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) 'solver' that (1) parses a
problem instance from the TSPLIB repository and (2) gropes around the
solution space by randomly generating tours. Sometimes I go as far as
implementing hill climbing.

Needless to say, these programs are _not_ serious attempts at
combinatorial optimization.
